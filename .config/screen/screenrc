# (may not work on older versions of screen)
# "layout autosave on" works only for explicitly named layouts in .screenrc.
# Namely, if you specified some layout as my-layout, switched to it within
# Screen session and detached, this last layout will be restored after the
# session is resumed. If you did not specify any layout in the configuration
# file, you have to run internal command "layout save my-layout-name" before
# detaching.
